## Why R?
---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Advantages of Stata]
- Stata is more specialized, which makes certain common tasks simpler
--

- Stata has wider adoption among micro-econometricians (though R adoption is steadily increasing).
--

- The implementation of frames in Stata 16 has made everything easier now
--

- Super intuitive

???
Running a regression with clustered standard errors
Analyzing survey data with weights

Network externalities in your work environment.
Development of new specialized techniques and tools could happen faster (e.g. ietoolkit).

## R vs Stata

### .f4[Advantages of Stata]
- R is a free and open source software!
--

-It allows you to have several datasets open simultaneously.
--

- No need to use `keep`, `preserve`, `restore`, or `tempfile` It can run complex Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses.

- You can use it for web scrapping.
--

- You can run machine learning algorithms with it.
--

- You can create complex Markdown documents. This presentation, for example, is entirely done in R.
--

- You can create interactive dashboards and online applications with the Shiny package.

## R Vs Python
