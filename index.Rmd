## Why R?
---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Differences]

* R is object oriented while Stata is action oriented:
  + Classic example: Stata's `summarize` vs R's `summary()`
  + In Stata you declare what you want to do, while in R you usually declare the result you want to get
--

* R needs to load non-base commands (packages) at the beginning of each session
  + Imagine that in Stata you'd have to load a command installed with `ssc install` every time you'll use it in a new session
  + There is a way to bypass this

---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Differences]

* R is less specialized, which means more flexibility and more functionalities.

* R has a much broader network of users:
  + More resources online, which makes using Google a lot easier. You'll never want to see Statalist again in your life!
  + Development of new features and bug fixes happen faster.


---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Advantages of Stata]

- Stata is more specialized, which makes certain common tasks simpler
--

- Stata has wider adoption among micro-econometricians (though R adoption is steadily increasing). 
--

- The implementation of frames in Stata 16 has made everything easier
--

- Super intuitive
--

- It is getting better and better with each upgrade

???
Running a regression with clustered standard errors
Analyzing survey data with weights

Network externalities in your work environment.
Development of new specialized techniques and tools could happen faster (e.g. ietoolkit).

---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Advantages of R]

- R is a free and open source software!

--

- It allows you to have several datasets open simultaneously.
    + No need to use `keep`, `preserve`, `restore`, or `tempfile` 
--

- It can run complex Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses.
--

- You can use it for web scrapping.
--

- You can run machine learning algorithms with it.
--

- You can create complex Markdown documents. This presentation, for example, is entirely done in R.
--
    + Latex, slides, websites, books, reports, Word documents, PPT presentations, etc.

---
## R vs Stata

### .f4[Advantages of R]

- It reads and works with no rectangular data
--

- You can create interactive dashboards and online applications with the Shiny package.
--

- Help online is amazing!
--

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) exists
    + Everything is integrated. The interface, the data, the code, git, and the outcome.
--

- R is constantly updated and fixed.

---
## R vs Python

.center[.f3[.light-red[Disclaimer: ]I don't know much about Python to make a fair assessment]]
---
## R vs Python

### .f4[in general]

- Python and R were created with different objectives.
    + Python was created as a general programming language
    + R was created for statistical analysis
--

- Over time both have moved slowly to the each other's side.
--

- You can find a "fair" comparison in this [PDF created by DataCamp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/email/other/Python+vs+R.pdf). 
--

   + I say "fair" because it is too general, and not specific for economists and social scientists. 

---
## R vs Python

### .f4[in general]

- I Prefer R because it is designed for and by academics, not developers.
--

- If there is something that I need to do in Python that I can't in R, I just run Python from R, get the results, and keep working on R. 
--

- Contrary to what some people say, I think R syntax is easier that Python's.
--

- Coding with `tidyverse` syntax of `data.table` syntax make the work extremely easy.
--

- You should learn both! 

---
## R vs Python

### .f4[... BUT!]

If I were going to teach my kids one programming language, it will Python.

## R vs Python

### .f4[Well, because]

- If it keeps getting more popularity than R, it will be more attractive in the CV. 
--

- It is a general programming language that allows them to create anything from scratch; not only useful for data analysis. 
--

- I will teach them R, anyway...

## Everything you need to start working with R
---

## Installation

you need R and RStudio installed in your computer:

### Instructions

* Please visit (https://cran.r-project.org) and select a Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) mirror close to you.

* To install RStudio, go to (https://www.rstudio.com/) .red[Note that you need to install R first.]

---

## Syntax

There are three main syntax

- base

- tidyverse

- data.table

---
layout:true
## Data in R

---

.f3[.red[Note: ]The rest of the slides are based on the book [advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham and a training imparted by DIME in the World Bank]

---

### In Stata:

* You can open __one dataset__ and perform operations that can change that dataset.

* You can also have other things, such as matrices, macros and tempfiles, but they are secondary. __Most functions only use the main dataset__.

* If you wish to do any non-permanent changes to your data, __you'll need to preserve the original data to keep it intact__.

---

### In R:

__R__ works in a completely different way: 
 
* You can load __as many datasets as you wish__ or your computer's memory allows

* Operations will have lasting effects __only if you store them__

---

### In R:

* Everything that exists in R's memory -- variables, datasets, functions -- __is an object__

* You could think of an object like a chunk of data with some properties that has a name by which you call it

* If you create an object, it's going to be stored in memory until you delete it or quit R

* Whenever you run anything you intend to use in the future, __you need to store it as an object__.

## packages

Make sure you install the following packages,

```{r packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # <-- this may take a while
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("gapminder")
```

---

## Preliminaty notions
---

## Objects and names
(Almost) Everything in R is an object

--

In R you create objects, which you can bind to a name 'x'. You do NOT create an object name 'x'.

```{r bind, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/raw/master/diagrams/name-value/binding-2.png")
```
---
## Vectors and functions

Simplifying, in R, 

Vectors contain the information; the data. 

--

Functions are instructions for what to DO with the data. 

---
## Vectors

There are two (well three) kind of vectors.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/raw/master/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree.png")
```

--

**Atomic vectors**: all elements must have the same type

__lists__: elements can have different types.

---
## Atomic vectors
.pull-left[
Since atomic vectors require that all elements are of the same type, there are four types .light-blue[(six in reality, but you won't use the other two: raw and complex)]
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/raw/master/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-atomic.png")
```
]


---
## Examples of atomic vectors
.pull-left[
```{r}
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

]
.pull-right[
Exlore `typeof` and `class`
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://rrmaximiliano.shinyapps.io/learnr-app/")
```
]
---
## Class of vectors (S3 object system)
.pull-left[
Classes are attributes of the vectors that inform the functions how to deal with
the vector

]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=450}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/raw/master/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-s3-1.png")
```
]

---
## List vectors
In lists, elements can be of any type.
```{r lists}
l1 <- list(
  1:3, 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)
typeof(l1)
str(l1)
```

---
## `data.frame`, a special kind of lists (..finally!)

data frames are the kind of rectangular tables that you use in Stata
```{r dataframe}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = letters[1:3])
typeof(df1)
attributes(df1)
```

---
## Better data.frames! `tibble` and `data.table`

Base R `data.frame`s are a great idea, but a little old. By trying to do more, the end up doing less and frustrate the users.

--

You should move to `tibble`s and/or `data.table`s.

--

```{r tibble}
library(tibble)    
library(data.table)

# Bad code on purpose
tb <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:3, y = letters[1:3])
dt <- data.table::data.table(x = 1:3, y = letters[1:3])
class(tb)
class(dt)
```

---
## Execute Stata from R

- You need to have Stata and R installed in your computer
--

- You need to install the package **RStata** in R, `install.packages('RStata')`.
--

- Open .Rprofile, `file.edit("~/.Rprofile")`, and add the following lines, changing the path and the Stata version

```{r RStata, eval=FALSE}
options(
  "RStata.StataPath" = "\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataMP-64\"",
  "RStata.StataVersion" = 16
)
```

--

That's it! 

---
## Execute Stata from R

```{r stata1, cache=TRUE}
stata_src <- "
sysuse auto
reg mpg weight
"
RStata::stata(stata_src)

```

---
## Execute Stata from R
```{r stata2, cache=TRUE}
x <- data.frame(a = rnorm(3), b = letters[1:3])
RStata::stata("sum a", data.in = x)
```
---
## Execute Stata from R

You can read more about it in

- Take a look at this [blog](https://fsolt.org/blog/2018/08/15/switch-to-r.html).
]
---
## Execute R from Stata

- Install **github** Stata package, `net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")`
--

- Install **rcall** Stata package, `github install haghish/rcall, stable`
-- 

- Take a look at all the examples in the help file `help rcall`

## Interlude
### .left[Executing Stata from R, and viceversa]
---
We will use the [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) data.

To make it easier to work with, we will use `df` as the name of the data rather than `gapminder`

```{r, include=TRUE, results="hide"}
# Load the data
library("tidyverse") 
library("data.table")
library("gapminder")
# Change name for convenience
df <- gapminder
```
